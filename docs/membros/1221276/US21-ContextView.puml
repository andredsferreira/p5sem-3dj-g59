' As an Admin, I want to edit existing operation types, so that I can update or correct information about the procedure.
'
' Acceptance Criteria:
'
' Admins can search for and select an existing operation type to edit.
' Editable fields include operation name, required staff by specialization, and estimated duration.
' Changes are reflected in the system immediately for future operation requests.
' Historical data is maintained, but new operation requests will use the updated operation type information.
