' As an Admin, I want to remove obsolete or no longer performed operation types, so that the system stays current with hospital practices.
'
' Acceptance Criteria:
'
' Admins can search for and mark operation types as inactive (rather than deleting them) to preserve historical records.
' Inactive operation types are no longer available for future scheduling but remain in historical data.
' A confirmation prompt is shown before deactivating an operation type.
