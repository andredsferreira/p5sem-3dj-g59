# US 6.5.4 - Control the Camera

As a **healthcare staff member**, I want to control the camera with the mouse.

Controls can either be created or imported (e.g., three.js addon OrbitControls or equivalent):
* Left button: unused for now. It will be defined in the next sprint
* Right button: orbit
* Wheel: Zoom or dolly

## 1. Context

This **US** is part of the **3D visualization module**.

## 2. Requirements

### 2.1. Acceptance Criteria

1. The user must be able to control the camera using their moused the way it was specified previously.

### 2.2. Dependencies

* No dependencies (explained in **2.3. Pre-Conditions**).

### 2.3. Pre-Conditions

* Although the camera will be centered on the **Hospital floor** created in [**US 6-5-1**](../6-5-1/readme.md), it can be easily set up using a template object.
