# US 6.5.2 - Apply textures to the 3D Visualization

As a **healthcare staff member**, I want to see appropriate textures (that is, suitable for use in representing a hospital or clinic) mapped onto the floor, walls and so on.

## 1. Context

This **US** is part of the **3D visualization module**.

## 2. Requirements

### 2.1. Acceptance Criteria

1. There mustn't be any objects without textures.
2. Textures must be suitable for use in representing a hospital or clinic.

### 2.2. Dependencies

This **US** depends on:
* [**US 6.5.1**](../6-5-1/readme.md), since the textures must be mapped into the structure built in that functionality.

### 2.3. Pre-Conditions

* The textures must be mapped onto the hospital structure, thus is must exist beforehand.

### 2.4. Open Questions

* No Open Questions
