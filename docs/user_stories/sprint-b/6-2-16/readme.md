# US 6.2.16 - Remove an operation requisition.

As a **Doctor**, I want to remove an operation requisition, so that the healthcare activities are provided as necessary.


## 1. Context

This **US** is part of the **Backoffice module**.

## 2. Requirements

### 2.1. Acceptance Criteria

1. Doctors can **search for an operation** and mark it for deletion.
2. Before deletion, the system prompts the doctor to confirm the action.
3. Once deleted, all operation data is permanently removed from the system within a predefined time frame.
4. The system logs the deletion for audit and GDPR compliance purposes.

### 2.2. Dependencies

* [**US 6.2.17**](../../sprint-b/6-2-17/readme.md)

### 2.3. Pre-Conditions

For this **US** to work, there needs to be an **Operation** inside the system.

### 2.4. Open Questions

This **US** has no **Open Questions** yet.

## 3. Analysis

This *US* is merely a *Frontend version* of another **US**, which contains the logic. Thus, this section does not apply here.
