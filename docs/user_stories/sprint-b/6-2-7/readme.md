# US 6.2.7 - Edit a Patient Profile

As an **Admin**, I want to edit a patient profile, so that I can update their information when needed.

## 1. Context

This **US** is the *Frontend* version of [**US 5.1.9**](../../sprint-a/us9/readme.md).

## 2. Requirements

### 2.1. Acceptance Criteria

1. Admins can **search for a patient profile** to edit.
2. Editable fields include name, contact information, medical history, and allergies.
3. Changes to sensitive data (e.g., contact information) trigger an email notification to the patient.
4. The system logs all profile changes for auditing purposes.

### 2.2. Dependencies

This **US** depends on:
* [**US 5.1.9**](../../sprint-a/us9/readme.md), since this functionality calls the *Web API* request to edit a *Patient Profile*.
* [**US 6.2.9**](../6-2-9/readme.md), since the user has to list *Patient Profiles* in order to select one to edit.

### 2.3. Pre-Conditions

For this **US** to work, there needs to be a **Patient Profile** inside the system ([**US 5.1.8**](../../sprint-a/us8/readme.md)).

### 2.4. Open Questions

This **US** has no **Open Questions** yet.

## 3. Analysis

This *US* is merely a *Frontend version* of another **US**, which contains the logic. Thus, this section does not apply here.
