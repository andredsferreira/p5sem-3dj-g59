# US 6.2.21 List/Search Operation Types (UI for US 5.1.23)

As an Admin, I want to list/search operation types, so that I can see the details, edit, and remove operation types. (UI for US 5.1.23)

## 1. Context

This US is the *Frontend* version of [**US 5.1.23**](../../sprint-a/us23/readme.md).

## 2. Requirements

### 2.1. Acceptance Criteria

1. Admins can search and filter operation types by name, specialization, or status (active/inactive).
2. The system displays operation types in a searchable list with attributes such as name, required staff, and estimated duration.
3. Admins can select an operation type to view, edit, or deactivate it.

### 2.2. Dependencies

This **US** depends on:
* [**US 5.1.23**] since this functionality calls the *Web API* request to search and list **Operation Types**.

### 2.3. Pre-Conditions

For this **US** to work, there needs to be **Operation Types** inside the system, hence the dependency on [**US 5.1.20**].

### 2.4. Open Questions

This **US** has no **Open Questions** yet.

## 3. Analysis

This *US* is the *Frontend version* of another **US**, which contains the logic. Thus, this section does not apply here.

## 4. Design

The team decided the following aspects:

* The user should be able to search for an existing operation type.
* The user should be able to filter the list of operation types by name, specialization, or status.
