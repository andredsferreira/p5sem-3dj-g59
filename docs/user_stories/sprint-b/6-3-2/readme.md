# US 6.3.2 - Study the complexity

As an **Admin**, I want to know till what dimension in terms of number of surgeries is possible to ask for the better solution.

Perform a complexity analysis of the problem to understand to which dimension it is feasible to ask for the better solution. Document your results and findings.

## 1. Context

This **US** is part of the **Planning module**.

## 2. Requirements

### 2.1. Acceptance Criteria

1. The team must run the program various times, analyzing the run-times and performing a complexity analysis.
2. The team must answer the question "Until what number of surgeries is it reasonable to ask for the best possible solution?".

### 2.2. Dependencies

No dependencies

### 2.3. Pre-Conditions

No pre-conditions

### 2.4. Open Questions

No open questions yet

## 3. Analysis

Through the requisites and the open questions, the team can conclude that:
* The team must run the given code several times, each time with one more operation to schedule, and register the results in order to document our findings.

## 4. Design

The team decided that the results were going to be placed in a table.

## 5. Implementation and Demonstration

These are specified in the [report](../6-3-1/report.pdf).
