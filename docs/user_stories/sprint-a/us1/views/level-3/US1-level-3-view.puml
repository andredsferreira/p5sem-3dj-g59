' 
' User Story: As an Admin,  I want to register new backoffice users (e.g., doctors, nurses, technicians, admins) via an out-of-band process, so that they can access the backoffice system with appropriate permissions.
'
' Acceptance Criteria:
' 
' - Backoffice users (e.g., doctors, nurses, technicians) are registered by an Admin via an internal process, not via self-registration.
' - Admin assigns roles (e.g., Doctor, Nurse, Technician) during the registration process.
' - Registered users receive a one-time setup link via email to set their password and activate their account.
' - The system enforces strong password requirements for security.
' - A confirmation email is sent to verify the user’s registration.
